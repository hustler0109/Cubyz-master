# Cubyz
Cubyz is a sandbox 3D voxel video game(aka minecraft clone). It is different to most other voxel games because it uses procedural content generation to make every single world unique in many ways(including ores, materials and tools).

Cubyz can easily be forked or modded to create a new game with 3D sandbox aspect.

## Textures
If you want to add new textures, make sure they fit the style of the game.
If any of the following points are ignored, your texture will be rejected:
1. The size of block and item textures must be 16Ã—16 Pixels.
2. There must be at most 16 different colors in the entire texture.
3. Textures should be shaded with hue shifting instead of darkening only.\
If you are not sure how to use hue shifting, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtMAxYaGyg) is a good video explaining it.
